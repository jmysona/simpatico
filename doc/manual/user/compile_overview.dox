Here is a brief summary of instructions for compiling all of the simpatico 
programs:

   - Modify unix environment variables: Add the path simpatico/bin to the 
     users PATH environment variable, and add simpatico/scripts/python to 
     the PYTHONPATH variable (as discussed \ref compile_environment_section 
     "here").

   - Change directory (cd) to the simpatico/ root directory.

   - Setup: From the simpatico root directory, run the setup script, by invoking
     \code 
     > ./setup
     \endcode

   - Configure optional features (optional): Use the configure script in 
     the simpatico/ root directory to enable any desired optional 
     compile-time features that are disabled by default (as discussed 
     \ref user_compile_configure_page "here").

   - Compile mcSim and mdSim: Compile and install the single-processor 
     mcSim and mdSim MC and MD programs, by invoking
     \code
     > make mcMd
     \endcode
     from the simpatico root directory. This will install executables 
     named "mdSim" and "mcSim" in the simpatico/bin directory.

   - Compile postprocessor: Compile and install the "mdPp" MD 
     post-processing analysis program, by invoking
     \code
     > make tools
     \endcode
     from the simpatico root directory. This will install the mdPp
     executable in the simpatico/bin directory.

   - Setup MPI: Set up your environment to allow compilation of MPI 
     programs (as discussed \ref user_compile_mpi_page "here"), if 
     not already done.

   - Compile mcSim_m and mdSim_m: Compile and install the multi-processor 
     versions of "mcSim" and "mdSim", which allow embarassingly parallel 
     simulations of multiple systems with one system per processor. To do
     this, invoke
     \code
     > make mcMd-mpi
     \endcode
     from the simpatico/ directory. If compilation succeeds (i.e., if 
     MPI is configured correctly), this will install executables named 
     "mcSim_m" and "mdSim_m" in the simpatico/bin directory. 

   - Compile ddSim: Compile and install the ddSim parallel domain decomposition 
     MD program, by invoking
     \code
     > make ddMd
     \endcode
     from the simpatico/ directory. This will install the "ddSim" executable 
     in the simpatico/bin directory.

Note that all commands should be issued from the simpatico/ root directory. 
The most potentially complicated part of compiling simpatico is the need to
set up an MPI library, which is only needed by the ddSim program and the 
multi-processor versions of mcSim and mdSim. Users who would like to compile
the single-processor mcSim and mdSim programs and begin experimenting with
those can simply follow the above instructions through the instruction to
invoke "make mcMd".

Each of the above steps is discussed in more detail in the following pages.
