For configuration files:

   1) SmpConfigWriter for McMd. This will allow config files
      to be generated. 

   2) Add functions for the base Simp::Species class to read 
      and write atom type and bonded group information for a
      species. Use this to read species information in DdMd.
      (Possible problem: Indentation in writing, if any).

   3) Add an array of Simp::Species objects to DdMd::Simulation,
      and an array containing the number of molecules of each
      type. 

   4) Write SmpConfigReader and SmpConfigWriter for DdMd.  The 
      reader should create classes groups from information in 
      the config file, if provided.

For trajectory files:

   1) Write trajectory file writer for DdMd.

   2) Write trajectory file reader and writer for McMd.

For topology file, if any:

   Proposal: Topology file is identical to SPECIES block of 
   config file.

Force field file (?):

    Consider creating another ForceField format to allow 
    communication of potential energy parameters and atom 
    labelling schemes between programs.

    Provide mechanism for McMd and DdMd programs to read
    in the force field before reading in remaining parameters
    of the potential energy.
