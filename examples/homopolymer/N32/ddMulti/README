Example of ddSim for 8 processors split between 2 systems, assigning four 
processors to each system. 

Usage:

Run simulation of two independent systems on 8 processors:

    mpirun -np 8 ddSim -s 2 -p param -c commands

Restart above simulation:

    mpirun -np 8 ddSim -s 2 -r restart -c commands.rst
