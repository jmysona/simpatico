All simulations in this directory tree are simulations of 100 
wormlike chains of 8 atoms. 

These simulations all require versions of the main programs
that have been compiled with angle potentials enabled. These
 created by cd'ing to bld/parallel, for parallel programs, or 
bld/serial, for serial programs, and entering

> ./configure -a1 

before recompiling. To compile in source (i.e., within the
src/ directory) enter the same command from that directory
before recompiling.
