All simulations in this directory tree are simulations of 100 
chains of 8 atoms each with angle and dihedral potentials. All 
of these examples use one of two initial configuration files in 
the "in/" subdirectory of this directory. 

These simulations all require versions of the main programs that 
have been compiled with angle and dihedral potentials enabled. 
These can be created by cd'ing to bld/parallel, for parallel 
programs, or bld/serial, for serial programs, and entering

> ./configure -a1 -d1

before recompiling these programs. To compile in source (within
the src/ directory), cd to the src/ directory enter the same
command, and enter make commands ("make mcMd and/or make ddMd")
from there.
